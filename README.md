ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Radhika Ravichandran. 

I'm a student of business analytics, learning to apply my expertise in data analysis & business intelligence in real-world business challenges. I have a keen interest in financial analytics, climate finance and deploying machine learning applications. Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy. . 

â€¢ :mountain_bicyclist: Hiking. Grateful for countless trails here in AZ, so many that I know I wouldn't be able to hike them all. 

â€¢	:ocean: Swimming and studying decompression theory, to replace not being in a tropical scuba diving environment at the moment. 

â€¢	:runner: Running, also looking for a triathlon training buddy in Tempe/Phoenix.
